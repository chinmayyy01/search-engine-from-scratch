Search Engine from Scratch (BM25 + Phrase Search)

A lightweight search engine built entirely from scratch using Python, implementing a positional inverted index, BM25 ranking, and exact phrase search, exposed via a FastAPI REST API.

This project demonstrates core Information Retrieval (IR) concepts without relying on external search libraries.


Features:

Positional Inverted Index (term → document → positions)

BM25 ranking algorithm (production-grade scoring)

Exact phrase search using positional matching

Stopword removal and query normalization

Contextual snippet generation with keyword highlighting

REST API built with FastAPI

Fully testable via browser or Swagger UI


Core Concepts Implemented:

Inverted Index construction

Term Frequency & Document Frequency

BM25 scoring with document length normalization

Positional indexing for phrase queries

Query tokenization and preprocessing

Ranking and result aggregation

Example Queries

Normal search:

/search?q=machine learning


Phrase search:

/search?q="machine learning"


Top-k results:

/search?q=machine learning&k=3


Why This Project Matters

This project focuses on fundamental search system design, mirroring concepts used in real-world engines like Elasticsearch and Lucene, but implemented manually to demonstrate deep understanding rather than library usage.


Possible Extensions

Query expansion

Field-based search

Ranking evaluation (MAP, NDCG)

Index persistence to disk

Frontend UI
